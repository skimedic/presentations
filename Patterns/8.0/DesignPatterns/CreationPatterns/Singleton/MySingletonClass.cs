/*
This approach ensures that only one instance is created and only when the instance is needed.
Also, the variable is declared to be volatile to ensure that assignment to the instance variable 
completes before the instance variable can be accessed.Lastly, this approach uses a syncRoot 
instance to lock on, rather than locking on the type itself, to avoid deadlocks.

This double-check locking approach solves the thread concurrency problems while avoiding an 
exclusive lock in every call to the Instance property method.
It also allows you to delay instantiation until the object is first accessed. In practice, 
an application rarely requires this type of implementation.In most cases, the static initialization 
approach is sufficient.
